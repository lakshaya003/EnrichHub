    - follow the instructions at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm

#### Using this template ####

This template sets you off in the right direction for your coursework. To get started:

* Run ```npm install``` from the project directory to install all the node packages.

* Run ```npm run build-db``` to create the database on Mac or Linux 
or run ```npm run build-db-win``` to create the database on Windows

* Run ```npm run start``` to start serving the web app (Access via http://localhost:3000)

Test the app by browsing to the following routes:

* http://localhost:3000
* http://localhost:3000/organiser
* http://localhost:3000/learner/start



You can also run: 
```npm run clean-db``` to delete the database on Mac or Linux before rebuilding it for a fresh start
```npm run clean-db-win``` to delete the database on Windows before rebuilding it for a fresh start

Please also read the document ```Working with this Template.pdf``` for further guidance.

##### Creating database tables #####

* All database tables should created by modifying the db_schema.sql 
* This allows us to review and recreate your database simply by running ```npm run build-db```
* Do NOT create or alter database tables through other means
